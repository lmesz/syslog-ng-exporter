# syslog-ng-exporter
syslog-ng stats exporter for prometheus


It parses the output of syslog-ng-ctl stats. It needs a default .syslog-ng.cnf. I am new in Go so its a mess lot of cop-paste,
there are lot of todos.

- [ ] extract syslog-ng-exporter.go
- [ ] write tests
- [ ] proper error handling
- [ ] describe the conf
